# About Me

![](image0.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="425"}

Hello! My name is **Riley Herber**, and I am a Bioinformatics Masters student at the University of Georgia. I graduated from UGA is a BS in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and enrolled into the Double Dawgs program.

## Background

While I am not currently in a research lab/position, I have past experience working under other Bioinformatics PhD students. I have experience with other programming languages such as:

-   MATLAB
-   C++
-   Python

I have basic data analysis and modeling experience with these languages.

## Statistical Background

I will be taking BIOS7010 alongside this course, but have taken Statistical Inference for the Life Sciences (BINF 8441) in the past, which introduced statistical topics such as probability, maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, linear regression etc.
