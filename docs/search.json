    "text": "Interpretation of fit model\nA simple linear regression was used to examine whether the presence of the tag “funny” (ascribed by users) was associated with low, average, or higher movie ratings than non-‘funny’ movies.. Movies tagged as “funny” had significantly higher average ratings compared to movies without this tag (β = 0.43, p = 0.0253). Funny movies average a rating of 3.69 compared to their unfunny counterparts at 3.26. While the model only explains a small proportion of total variation in ratings (R2 = 0.0005), there does appear to be a significant relationship here. This was a fun analysis, and I was surprised that funnier movies actually had a positive impact on user rating."
